## About
This project is an e-commerce website I built for a fictional clothing brand (Redux Co.). See the "About Us" section on the site for more details!

The project started when I followed a tutorial for building a simple shopping cart app using React and Redux. I changed up the style of the shop, added some items, and started to implement more functionality & features to mimic an online shopping experience.

My favorite feature/component is the `RandomItem` component that is displayed on the home page and used in the 404 routing. I thought it would be a good fit for the home page so that users could quickly get an idea of what this store sells, and I think integrates well with the 404 page in attempting to get the lost user back on track. A random message is also displayed with the random item; the messages displayed on the Home page and 404 page are different. For me, it was refreshing to have a spark of an idea like this, be able to bring it to life, and see it fully functioning!

Enjoy!
